# Operations Manual Fork for Submitting Pull Requests Upstream
The purpose of  this forked repository is solely for  creating Pull Requests to
the [upstream repository][upstream], for Neo4j's Operations Manual.
Therefore does  not contain any  branches or tags  from upstream; and  the only
branches are either actively worked on pull requests; or backup of current work
for a future pull request.

[upstream]: https://github.com/neo4j/docs-operations
